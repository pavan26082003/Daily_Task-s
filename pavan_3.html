<p>The structure of a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) consists of several components, each serving a specific purpose. Here's the general structure:
<br>
<b>protocol:</b>//username:password@hostname:port/path?query#fragment.

<h2><i> Explanation of Components:</i></h2>
<h3>1. **Protocol (Scheme)**:  </h3>
   Specifies the protocol used to access the resource. Examples include:
   - `http` (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
   - `https` (Secure HTTP)
   - `ftp` (File Transfer Protocol)
   - `mailto` (Email links)
   <br><strong> Example:</strong> `https://`

<h3>2. **Username:Password (Optional)**:  </h3>
   Provides user credentials for accessing restricted resources.  
  <br><strong> Example:</strong> `username:password@`

<h3>3. **Hostname**: </h3> 
   Indicates the domain name or IP address of the server hosting the resource.  
   <br><strong>Example:</strong> `www.example.com`

<h3>4. **Port (Optional)**:  </h3>
   Specifies the port number to connect to on the server. If omitted, the default port is used based on the protocol (e.g., 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS).  
   <br><strong>Example:</strong>`:8080`

<h3>5. **Path**:  </h3>
   Indicates the specific resource or file on the server. It can also include directories.  
   <br><strong>Example:</strong>`/folder/subfolder/file.html`

<h3>6. **Query (Optional)**: </h3> 
   Contains parameters passed to the server, typically in key-value pairs.  
  <br><strong>Example:</strong> `?key1=value1&key2=value2`

<h3>7. **Fragment (Optional)**: </h3> 
   Points to a specific part of the resource, often used in HTML documents to navigate to a section identified by an `id` attribute.  
   <br><strong>Example:</strong>
<storng>Example URL</strong><mark>
https://www.example.com:443/folder/file.html?search=query#heading  </mark>
<br>
<h1><mark>Breakdown:</mark></h1><b>
- Protocol: `https`<br>
- Hostname: `www.example.com`<br>
- Port: `443`<br>
- Path: `/folder/file.html`<br>
- Query: `?search=query`<br>
- Fragment: `#heading`<br></b>
<br>
This structure ensures URLs are standardized and allow web browsers and servers to interact effectively.</p>

<h1><mark>Software Development Methodologies</mark> </h1>
<p>

<h3> 1. Agile Methodology </h3>
How it Operates: 
- Iterative and flexible approach with frequent delivery of working software.  
- Work is broken into small cycles (sprints) with continuous feedback.  
<br>
<b>**Best For:**  </b> 
- Dynamic projects where requirements may change (e.g., mobile apps, games).  
- Teams needing close collaboration and fast deliveries.


<br><br>
<h3>2. Scrum (Agile Framework)</h3> 
**How it Operates:**  
- Uses short, time-boxed iterations called sprints (2–4 weeks).  
- Involves daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospective meetings.
<br>
<b>**Best For:**  </b>
- Projects requiring frequent updates and rapid progress (e.g., e-commerce platforms).  
- Teams with defined roles like Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Development Team.


<br><br>
<h3>3. Waterfall Methodology  </h3>
**How it Operates:**  
- Sequential and linear process where each phase (requirement → design → development → testing → deployment) must be completed before the next begins.  
<BR>
<b>**Best For:**  </b> 
- Projects with fixed, well-defined requirements (e.g., government projects, basic static websites).  
- Simple and small-scale developments.
<br><br>

<h3> 4. DevOps  </h3>
**How it Operates:**  
- Integrates development and operations teams to automate testing, integration, and deployment.  
- Emphasizes Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD).  
<br>
<b>**Best For:**  </b> 
- Large-scale projects requiring frequent releases (e.g., SaaS platforms, cloud services).  
- Teams aiming for faster delivery and improved collaboration.



<h2> <mark>Summary:<mark> </h2> 
<b>
- Agile: For dynamic and evolving projects.  <br>
- Scrum: For structured team collaboration and frequent delivery. <br> 
- Waterfall: For projects with stable requirements.  <br>
- DevOps: For frequent updates and automation.<br>

<h1>Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</h1>
<img src="https://kms-solutions.asia/wp-content/uploads/Software-Development-cycle-1.webp" width="550",height="550">
<p>
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a systematic process used to design, develop, and maintain software applications. It provides a framework for ensuring software quality, meeting user requirements, and managing time and cost effectively.

<h2><i>Stages of SDLC</i></h2>

<h3>1. **Requirement Analysis**  </h3>
   - **Objective:** Gather and analyze the requirements from stakeholders.  <br>
   - **Activities:**
     - Identify user needs and business goals.
     - Document functional and non-functional requirements. <br> 
   - **Output:** Software Requirement Specification (SRS).

---

<h3>2. **Planning** </h3> 
   - **Objective:** Define the project scope, resources, timeline, and costs. <br> 
   - **Activities:**
     - Create a project plan.
     - Assess risks and prepare mitigation strategies. <br> 
   - **Output:** Detailed project roadmap.

---

<h3>3. **System Design**  </h3>
   - **Objective:** Define the system architecture and design based on the requirements.  <br>
   - **Activities:**
     - Create high-level design (HLD) for overall structure.
     - Develop low-level design (LLD) for detailed components.<br>
   - **Output:** Design Document.

---

<h3>4. **Implementation (Coding)**</h3>  
   - **Objective:** Convert the design into actual software by writing code.<br>  
   - **Activities:**
     - Use programming languages and tools to build the software.
     - Perform unit testing for individual modules.<br>
   - **Output:** Working software modules.

---

<h3>5. **Testing**  </h3>
   - **Objective:** Ensure the software meets requirements and is free of defects.  <br>
   - **Activities:**
     - Perform functional, integration, system, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
     - Identify and fix bugs.  <br>
   - **Output:** Tested and validated software.

---

<h3>6. **Deployment** </h3> 
   - **Objective:** Deliver the software to the production environment.<br>  
   - **Activities:**
     - Deploy the software on servers or devices.
     - Provide user training and documentation.  <br>
   - **Output:** Live software accessible to users.

---

<h3>7. **Maintenance**  </h3>
   - **Objective:** Ensure the software continues to perform optimally after deployment.  <br>
   - **Activities:**
     - Fix bugs or issues reported by users.
     - Release updates or enhancements as needed.  <br>
   - **Output:** Updated and well-maintained software.

<h3>Common SDLC Models</h3>
<b>1. Waterfall Model:</b> Linear, phase-by-phase approach.  <br>
<b>2. Agile Model:</b>Iterative, flexible with continuous delivery.  <br>
<b>3. Iterative Model:</b> Develop software incrementally in cycles.  <br>
<b>4. V-Model:</b>Testing is planned in parallel with development.  <br>
<b>5. Spiral Model:</b> Combines iterative development with risk analysis. <br> 


<h3>Benefits of SDLC</h3>
<b>- Clarity:</b> Well-defined stages ensure transparency and better communication.  <br>
<b>- Quality Assurance:</b> Regular testing ensures reliability and defect-free software.  <br>
<b>- Cost-Efficiency:</b> Early risk identification saves time and money.  <br>
<b>- Adaptability: </b>Models like Agile allow handling changing requirements.<br>  




<h3>When to Use SDLC</h2>
SDLC is used for any structured software project, from small applications to complex enterprise systems, ensuring consistent and predictable results.
